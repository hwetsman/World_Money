# Assessing time series of assets against world money supply

## Background
Modern markets are international. It is common for investors to place a portion of their assets on continents different from where they call home. Gone are the days when an economy is dependent on the decisions made by it's local users only (if, indeed, such days ever existed). Gone also are the days when decisions by a nation's central bank affected only that nation. 

The world's largest central banks have, in recent years, seemed to take turns producing liquidity for world markets. This means that anyone wanting to analyze the performance of a large asset class needs to control for, not only the local nation's central bank assets, but the assets of all the large central banks. Unfortunately, that information is not easily available.
